wview-rrd - Interactive RRDTool graphs for wview weather stations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<wview-rrd> updates Round Robin Database files from a local wview
SQLite database file.  B<cgi-bin/weather> then generates interactive
graphs of the weather data from these RRD files to a web browser.

See B<EXAMPLES> below for an example web site.

Features of the CGI web interface include:

  * show all weather variables in high resolution time series graphs
  * change displayed units, with configurable defaults
  * zoom the displayed time frame: year, month, week, day, hour, custom
  * scroll the displayed time frame of the graphs left/right
  * change graph plot size (width x height)
  * change data resolution - detailed, hourly, daily and so on
  * at wider resolutions, show average line in min/max area
  * add graphs of extra sensor data
  * show (min < avg < max) last, of plotted data in the legend
  * show many times of a graph at once (just click a graph)
  * export the data of any graph to csv, xml, json or see RRD code
  * all widgets / links have mouse balloon tooltip clues

=head1 INSTALLATION

Install the data collector and data presentation code:

	cp -p or ln -s bin/* to /usr/bin/ or the location of other wv* code

	cp -p or ln -s cgi-bin/* to your web server's cgi-bin/ directory

	edit cgi-bin/weather.pl config file as needed - make sure
	$where is the directory that holds your weather .sdb files.

http://localhost/cgi-bin/weather should now show an interface, but
with broken graphs since the RRD files don't yet exist.  Click y and
<< a couple times to zoom out to a 4 year view.  You can refresh this
in a moment to see the data coming in as you run the data collector.

These graphs track accumulated rain per year, automatically resetting
to 0 at the beginning of each year.  So, you can optionally find out
how many inches of rain you had in the year up to the start date of
your station.  This needs passed to wview-rrd when it first generates
the RRD files.  If you don't know, the default value is 0.

Run as root, passing starting inches of rain as the only argument:

	umask 022
	cd /var/lib/wview/archive # location of wview-archive.sdb
	wview-rrd 6.17 # where "6.17" is inches of rain to start, or 0

Be patient - this first run will take a while as all your station data
is stored in the RRD files.  Refresh the weather URL above to see the
data coming in.  Confirm 3 RRD files are created in the current
directory, along side the wview-archive.sdb source database file.
After finished, run wview-rrd again and it should complete much faster
as it just adds any new data.

Set up automated updates of the RRD files after generating the HTML
files.  Do this by adding a few lines to /etc/wview/post-generate.sh:

	umask 022
	cd /var/lib/wview/archive # location of wview-archive.sdb
	wview-rrd > /tmp/wview-rrd.log 2>&1 &

Add your initial YTD inches of rain as above if known.  This allows a
simple rm *.rrd to recreate them at any time with correct initial rain
amount.  Sometimes remove and regenerate is needed if you have edited
data in the source database.
